## Recipe Generator: Combining Arrays

Now we have two arrays in our workspace which contain our food items and some information about their properties. But we want to combine them into one array in order to move forward.

How can we combine our two arrays into a new one that includes all of our recipe items? You probably guessed: there is a method for that!

As mentioned earlier in this lesson, there are many different built-in methods we can use to iterate through an array.  While some methods iterate through an array and return nothing, like `.forEach()`, other methods iterate through an array and return data, another array for example.

The [`.concat()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) is used to merge two or more arrays and return a new array. Perfect for our purposes!  In order to combine two arrays using the `.concat()` method we would need to create a new array using the following syntax: `var arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2);` 

Let's give it a shot.

#### `.concat()` Exercise

You now have two arrays in your code window. One called `guestFoods` and one called `myFoods`.

    // two arrays
    var guestFoods = [  
        {food:'chicken', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
        {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'rice', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},  
        ] //provided array
    var myFoods = [  
        {food:'beef', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'pear', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
        {food:'kale', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'potato', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},  
        ] //user array (user makes this)

1. Use `.concat()` to combine the `guestFoods` and `myFoods` arrays into a new array titled `allFoods`.

        //your code should look like this
        var guestFoods = [  
            {food:'chicken', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'}, 
            {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'rice', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},
            ] //provided array
        var myFoods = [  
            {food:'beef', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'pear', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},
            {food:'kale', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'potato', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},
            ] //user array (user makes this)

        var allFoods = guestFoods.concat(myFoods);

2. Now `console.log()` the new array, `allFoods`.

        //your code should look like this
        var guestFoods = [  
            {food:'chicken', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},
            {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'rice', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},
            ] //provided array
        var myFoods = [  
            {food:'beef', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'pear', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},
            {food:'kale', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},
            {food:'potato', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},
            ] //user array (user makes this)

        var allFoods = guestFoods.concat(myFoods);
        console.log(allFoods);
    
Amazing! Now that we have all of our food organized in one place we can start generating our recipe and choosing specific ingredients.
