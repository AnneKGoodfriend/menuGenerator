# Iteration and Arrays

In this lesson, we will use and discover **built-in methods** to iterate through an array. Using our new skills we will build our own Recipe Generator that will help us create some dishes for a party we are planning.

JavaScriptâ€™s built-in methods are **actions that can be performed on objects**, which in this case are arrays. Built-in methods **always contain a function** which defines the action that is taken on the object.

As of ES5 (now supported by roughly 98% of browsers), JavaScript supplies a number of built-in methods for array iteration. In this lesson, we'll go through some of the most useful methods.  You can see a few of the methods we will work with today in your workspace. 

    //code for workspace
    var array = ['item1', 'Item2', 'Item3', 'Item4'];
    
    // the .forEach method         
    array.forEach(function(item) {  
            console.log(item);
    });
    
    // the .filter method
    var newArray =  fridgeContents.filter(function(item) {   
        item != Item2 
    });
