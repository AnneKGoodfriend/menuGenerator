## Recipe Generator: Filtering our Ingredients

There is a guest coming to the party who is vegetarian and you want to sort out only the food that they can eat, i.e. the food that is not meat.

Let's use a built-in method to iterate through our array and filter out the results that aren't the type 'meat' into a new array.

But first, let's take a moment the remember how we would do this using a standard `for loop`.
It would look something like this:

    // for loop filter and push
    var foodObjects = [
        {food:'chicken', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},
        {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},
        {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},
        {food:'rice', type:'grain', flavor:'savory'},
    ]
    var vegetarianItems = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < foodObjects.length; i++) {
        if (foodObjects[i].type != 'meat'){
            vegetarianItems.push(foodObjects[i].food);
        }
    };

There's a lot of code in there. We could make this shorter by using an array method to filter our results and sort them into a new array. 

Can you find a method that will do just this by [looking through the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)?

The `.filter()` method should do the trick! This method creates a new array with all elements from the current array that pass a test which is carried out by the provided callback function.

Let's give it a try!

#### `.filter()` Exercise

In your editor, you should see the `allFoods` array that we made in the last exercise.

    // your array should look like this
    allFoods = [  
    {food:'chicken', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
        {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'rice', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'beef', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'pear', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
        {food:'kale', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
        {food:'potato', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'}  
    ]



1. Create a variable under the array and call it `sortedType` and assign it the value “meat”.

        // your variable should look like this
        var sortedType = 'meat';

2. Use the `.filter()` method to sort through `allFoods` and filter out the results that do not equal `sortedType` into an array called `ingredients`.

        // your new code should look like this
        var sortedType = 'meat';
        var ingredients = allFoods.filter(function(food){    
              return food.type != sortedType; // 
        });  


3. Now console log the resulting array, `ingredients`, on a line below your other code.

        // your final code should look like this
        allFoods = [  
            {food:'chicken', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},  
            {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
            {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
            {food:'rice', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},  
            {food:'beef', type:'meat', flavor:'savory'},  
            {food:'pear', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
            {food:'kale', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
            {food:'potato', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'}  
        ]

        var sortedType = 'meat';
        var ingredients = allFoods.filter(function(food){    
              return food.type != sortedType; // 
        });  
        console.log(ingredients);

The array `ingredients` should contain only the food items that don't have the property `type:'meat'`. 

    // your ingredients array might look like this
    [ {food:'apple', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
    {food:'broccoli', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
    {food:'rice', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'},  
    {food:'pear', type:'fruit', flavor:'sweet'},  
    {food:'kale', type:'vegetable', flavor:'savory'},  
    {food:'potato', type:'starch', flavor:'savory'}  ]

Now we have a list of all of our foods that we can use in our meat free recipe. Let's keep building this recipe!
